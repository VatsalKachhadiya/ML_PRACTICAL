# ensemble-learning
Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking). Ensemble methods can be divided into two groups: sequential ensemble methods where the base learners are generated sequentially (e.g. AdaBoost) and parallel ensemble methods where the base learners are generated in parallel (e.g. Random Forest). The basic motivation of sequential methods is to exploit the dependence between the base learners since the overall performance can be boosted by weighing previously mislabeled examples with higher weight. The basic motivation of parallel methods is to exploit independence between the base learners since the error can be reduced dramatically by averaging.
